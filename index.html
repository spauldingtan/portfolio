            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>If you couldn't tell by the title of the page, or the header, my name is Tanner Spaulding. :) I'm 22 years old,
               and I was born and raised in Utah.</p>
            <p>I currently work as a Team Lead at a warehouse in Lehi called Younique, and I have worked there for about
                7 months now.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>There are quite a few things that I like to do, most of which involve technology of some sort. (i.e.
            video games, computer programming, etc.)</p>
            <p>All throughout high school I was convinced that I was going to be a famous singer when i grew up.
               I don't play music as much as I did in high school, but I still love to play from time to time.</p>
            <p>My main instrument is the guitar, but I also play the piano, and sing.</p>
